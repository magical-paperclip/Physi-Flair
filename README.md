# sics-ground: the internet's favorite phys. playground

an intuitive physics sandbox built on matter.js allows you to experiment with realistic object interactions, create shapes, watch them collide, and explore dynamic effectsâ€”all in real time.

## features
- real-time physics simulation with matter.js
- four unique colision effects:
  - bounce: enhanced elastic colisions with visual feedback
  - explode: particle-based explosions, scaled to impact force
  - stick: attractive forces between colliding objects
  - gravity shift: dynamic gravity changes upon collision
- interactive shape creation:
  - easily add cirlces, squares, and polygons
  - click anywhere on the canvas to generate random shapes
- advanced particle systems:
  - custom explosion particles with diverse behaviors
  - motion trails for fast-moving objects
  - entry and collision animations
- optimized rendering for hidpi/retina displays

## technical implementation
### physics engine
built on matter.js with enhanced colision and response settings.

### rendering pipeline
utilizes:
- matter.js native renderer for physics bodies
- custom canvas api for particle effects
- css animations for ui elements  
optimized with:
- adaptive pixel ratio detection for retina displays
- batch rendering for particle systems
- selective updates based on visibility

### particle system architecture
- efficient memory pooling to maintain 60 fps
- optimized particle behaviors for smooth performance

### event handling
combines:
- matter.js events module for physics interactions
- dom events for user engagement
- intersectionobserver api for scroll-based triggers

## performance optimizations
- object pooling minimizes gc pauses
- selective rendering boosts performance
- sleep optimization for static bodies
- fixed timestep ensures consistent physics
- viewport-based pause/resume saves cpu when not visible

## future enhancements
- webgl renderer for enhanced graphics
- physics constraint tool for joints/connections
- touch optimization for mobile devices
- physics presets for educational demos
- export/import system for sharing creations
